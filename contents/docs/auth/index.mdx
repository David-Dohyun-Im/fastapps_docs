# Authentication

Authentication features for FastApps are coming soon!

We're working on adding powerful authentication capabilities with simple decorators like `@auth_required`.

## Coming Soon

In the next few days, we'll be adding:

- **Simple Decorators**: Use `@auth_required` to protect your widgets and tools
- **Multiple Auth Providers**: Support for various authentication methods
- **Session Management**: Automatic session handling and validation
- **User Context**: Access to authenticated user information in your widgets

## Preview

Here's a preview of how authentication will work:

```python
from fastapps import BaseWidget, auth_required

@auth_required
class ProtectedWidget(BaseWidget):
    identifier = "protected-widget"
    title = "Protected Widget"
    
    async def execute(self, input_data, user_context):
        # user_context contains authenticated user info
        return {
            "message": f"Hello, {user_context.name}!",
            "user_id": user_context.id
        }
```

## Stay Tuned

Keep an eye on our updates - authentication features will be available very soon!

For now, you can build widgets without authentication. When the auth features are ready, existing widgets will continue to work, and you'll be able to add authentication with just a simple decorator.
