## 🚀 Create Your First Widget

```bash
pip install fastapps
fastapps create greeting
```

- Installs dependencies
- Creates a Python tool in `server/tools/`
- Generates a React widget in `widgets/`
- Wires everything into the FastApps runtime

## ▶️ Run the Development Server

```bash
fastapps dev
```

- Starts the FastApps dev server
- Hot reloads your Python and React code
- Opens the preview in ChatGPT-compatible mode

## 🧪 Test the Widget

Call your widget from Python:

```python
from fastapps import FastApps

client = FastApps()
response = client.call("greeting", name="Ada")
print(response)
```

The widget renders inside ChatGPT with the provided data.
