title: What is FastApps?
---

FastApps is a zero-boilerplate framework for building ChatGPT apps.

Use it to create rich, interactive experiences that render directly inside ChatGPT. You can build data visualizations, forms, interactive tools, and complex UI components that communicate seamlessly with your Python backend.

Here's a simple Hello World widget to show how easy it is:

**Python Backend** (`server/tools/hello_tool.py`):
```python
from fastapps import BaseWidget, Field
from pydantic import BaseModel

class HelloInput(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(default="World", description="Name to greet")

class HelloTool(BaseWidget):
    identifier = "hello"
    title = "Hello Widget"
    input_schema = HelloInput
    
    async def execute(self, input_data: HelloInput):
        return {
            "message": f"Hello, {input_data.name}!",
            "emoji": "üëã"
        }
```

**React Frontend** (`widgets/hello/index.jsx`):
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useWidgetProps } from 'fastapps';

export default function HelloWidget() {
  const props = useWidgetProps();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Key Features

FastApps provides everything you need to build sophisticated ChatGPT widgets:

**Widget Registration**: Use the `BaseWidget` class to simply register it as an MCP tool. We handle the rest - no complex configuration or manual registration needed.

**Advanced Features with a Single Decorator**: Authentication, state management, and other advanced features are all handled with our simple decorators. Just add `@auth_required` or `@stateful` and you're done.

**OpenAI Hooks**: We've transformed OpenAI's Apps SDK functions into a clean library. Simply import and use hooks like `useWidgetProps()`, `useWidgetState()`, and `useOpenAiGlobal()` without dealing with the raw SDK complexity.

## Solutions We Provide

FastApps solves the three biggest challenges in building ChatGPT widgets:

**Complex setup**: Traditional approaches require extensive boilerplate, manual registration, and complex build systems. FastApps eliminates all of this with a simple two-file structure and automatic discovery.

**State management**: Managing persistent state across ChatGPT sessions is complex. FastApps provides `useWidgetState()` that automatically persists your data and syncs across conversations.

**API integration**: Connecting to external APIs while handling security policies and data flow is challenging. FastApps handles CSP configuration and provides a clean data flow from Python to React.

## Getting Started

Ready to build your first widget? Follow our step-by-step guide:

1. **Install FastApps**: `pip install fastapps`
2. **Create a project**: `fastapps init my-app`
3. **Generate a widget**: `fastapps create my-widget`
4. **Edit the two files** and start building!

## What Makes FastApps Different?

Most frameworks force you to deal with:
- ‚ùå Complex project configuration
- ‚ùå Manual widget registration
- ‚ùå Boilerplate setup code
- ‚ùå Build system configuration

FastApps eliminates all of that:
- ‚úÖ **Auto-discovery**: Widgets are automatically found and registered
- ‚úÖ **Two files per widget**: One Python file, one React file. That's it.
- ‚úÖ **CLI scaffolding**: Generate widgets instantly
- ‚úÖ **Type-safe**: Pydantic for Python, TypeScript for React
- ‚úÖ **Modern React**: Use hooks like `useWidgetProps()` and `useWidgetState()`
