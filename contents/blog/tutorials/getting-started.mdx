# Getting Started: Build Your First App

Welcome to our comprehensive getting started guide! In this tutorial, we'll walk you through building your first application from scratch. By the end of this guide, you'll have a fully functional app up and running.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:

- Node.js 18.x or higher installed
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript
- A code editor (we recommend VS Code)
- Git installed on your machine

## Step 1: Installation

First, let's install our CLI tool:

```bash
npm install -g fastapps-cli
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
fastapps --version
```

## Step 2: Create Your Project

Create a new project using our CLI:

```bash
fastapps create my-first-app
cd my-first-app
```

This will scaffold a new project with all the necessary files and dependencies.

## Step 3: Project Structure

Your project structure should look like this:

```
my-first-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Step 4: Start Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Step 5: Make Your First Changes

Open `src/app/page.tsx` and modify the content:

```tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <p>This is my first app!</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Save the file and watch your changes appear instantly in the browser!

## Step 6: Deploy Your App

When you're ready to deploy:

```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You've just built and deployed your first app.

## Next Steps

Now that you have your first app running, here are some things to explore next:

1. **Add Components**: Learn how to create reusable components
2. **State Management**: Understand how to manage application state
3. **Styling**: Customize your app's appearance
4. **API Integration**: Connect to external APIs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port already in use:**
```bash
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

**Installation errors:**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```
