# Version 2.0: A Major Milestone

We're thrilled to announce the release of version 2.0! This major update brings significant improvements, new features, and a better developer experience.

## 🎉 What's New

### 1. Enhanced Performance

We've completely rewritten our core engine, resulting in:

- **50% faster** build times
- **30% smaller** bundle sizes
- **Zero-config** optimization
- Improved tree-shaking

### 2. New Component Library

Introducing 50+ new pre-built components:

- Advanced data tables
- Interactive charts and graphs
- Rich text editors
- File upload with drag & drop
- And much more!

### 3. Improved Developer Experience

Making your life easier with:

```bash
# Hot Module Replacement is now 3x faster
npm run dev

# New interactive setup wizard
fastapps init

# Enhanced error messages with solutions
fastapps diagnose
```

### 4. Better Type Safety

Full TypeScript support with improved type inference:

```typescript
// Auto-completion and type checking everywhere
import { createApp } from 'fastapps'

const app = createApp({
  // Full IntelliSense support
  theme: {
    colors: {
      primary: '#007bff'
    }
  }
})
```

### 5. Built-in Testing Utilities

No more configuration hassle:

```typescript
import { render, screen } from 'fastapps/testing'

test('renders button', () => {
  render(<Button>Click me</Button>)
  expect(screen.getByText('Click me')).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```

## 🔧 Breaking Changes

To ensure a smooth upgrade, we've minimized breaking changes:

### API Routes

**Before:**
```typescript
export async function handler(req, res) {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello' })
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  return Response.json({ message: 'Hello' })
}
```

### Configuration

**Before:**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: require('./theme.js')
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
export default {
  theme: './theme.ts'
}
```
